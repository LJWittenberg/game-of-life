# Game of Life Goals and Milestones

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
- [x] Set up Git repository
- [x] Create initial project structure

## Phase 1.1: Conversion of previous Implementation
- [x] Convert old code from Game-of-Life c into Python
- [x] Attempt to refactor Maze-solver code for the Game UI

## Phase 2: Basic Implementation
- [x] Implement the game grid and rules in Python
- [x] Create a grid representation using Tkinter
- [x] Implement basic cell logic (alive or dead)

## Phase 3: Game Functionality
- [x] Implement game loop to update the grid
- [x] Transfer Gol logic onto the canvas
- [x] Add functionality to start and stop the game
- [x] Allow users to set initial state interactively

## Phase 4: Enhancements
- [x] Add functionalities to load
- [x] Add performance improvements for larger grids

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement random initial configurations in addition to the initial generation. (Let Chaos ensue)
- [ ] Improve program cancelation
- [ ] Improve the O complexity of the game. --> Faster
- [ ] Implement different visualization options
- [ ] improve: Allow users to set initial state interactively
