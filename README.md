Conway's Game of Life implementation by Lennard Wittenberg in the language Python
=================================================================================
project task for [Bootdev-course-personal-project-1](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend)
My aim with this project is to complete my first implementation of the Game of Life C. At the time I wasn't able to finish the project in University and had leave in a incomplete state.


## What is the Game of Life short explenation 
This is the describtion by the Cornell University  
The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automaton ) is played on an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes each turn of the game (also called a generation) depending on the statuses of that cell's 8 neighbors.

## How access and use the project.
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd <project-directory>`
3. **Run the program**: Execute `python main.py` in your terminal
4. **Follow the prompts**: Enter the a series of coordinates for the two dimensional game grid. (x,y) These coordinates will become the first cell generation.

## State of the project
- rules work in progress
- unit tests work in progress
- visual representation work in progress
- handeling and code combination work in progress
